# Dino_Game
This project uses a webcam to detect hand gestures and simulates keyboard presses accordingly. Specifically:
	•	It tracks hand movements using OpenCV and a hand detector.
	•	If no fingers are up, it simulates pressing the space key (useful for games like Chrome’s Dinosaur Game).
	•	The directkeys.py file handles low-level key presses using Windows API.

Main Function: Controls a game or application using hand gestures instead of a keyboard.
